**1. The "Vanishing Gradient" Risk**
*   **Repo Status:** **Acknowledged, not Solved.**
    *   **Findings:** Track 11 ("Infinite Depth") verifies that gradients *can* propagate through 100 layers. However, the README explicitly includes a disclaimer: *"Gradient signal decay (even with L < 1) is an open question for scaling to 10,000 layers."*
    *   **Implication:** The code proves it doesn't *explode*, but it doesn't prove the signal remains useful for complex learning tasks at extreme depth. The risk remains high.

**2. The "O(1) Memory" Reality**
*   **Repo Status:** **Implemented in Kernel, Missing in User API.**
    *   **Findings:** The README admits the primary PyTorch implementation uses Autograd, which destroys the O(1) benefit. The `kernel/` folder (Pure NumPy/CuPy) is cited as the proof of O(1).
    *   **Implication:** The "Super-Sim" track is strictly necessary because the user-facing tools currently consume $O(N)$ memory, negating one of the main selling points.

**3. The "Lazy Update" Performance**
*   **Repo Status:** **Algorithmic Success, Hardware Unproven.**
    *   **Findings:** Track 12 claims "97% FLOP savings."
    *   **Implication:** Saving FLOPs does not mean saving Time on a GPU. GPUs hate sparsity (branch divergence). The repo shows *mathematical* efficiency, but likely suffers from *hardware* inefficiency on standard GPUs.


### Revised Master Development Plan

This plan prioritizes **engine integrity** and **scientific validation**. Visualization (UI) is moved to the end, serving only as a victory lap once the physics are proven.

#### **Track 1: The "Super-Sim" Engine (Safe Optimization)**
**Objective:** Replace the slow PyTorch simulation with a high-performance custom engine without breaking scientific validity.

*   **Stage 1.1: The "Golden Reference" Harness**
    *   **Action:** Create a strict unit-test harness that runs the existing `src/` (PyTorch Autograd) implementation alongside any new kernel.
    *   **Protocol:** Every relaxation step of the new engine must match the existing implementation to within `1e-6` tolerance.
    *   **Why:** You are about to write complex, risky code. You need the existing "slow but correct" code to catch regressions instantly.

*   **Stage 1.2: The "Fused State" Kernel (Triton/CUDA)**
    *   **Action:** Move the relaxation loop (`T` steps) entirely into a fused GPU kernel. Keep weights in HBM, but keep neuron states in SRAM (L1/Shared Memory) during the loop.
    *   **Constraint:** Implement this for *dense* layers first. Do not attempt "Lazy Updates" yet.
    *   **Goal:** Achieve 10x wall-clock speedup over the PyTorch loop while maintaining bit-exact accuracy.

*   **Stage 1.3: The "Lazy" Scheduler (Sparse Kernel)**
    *   **Action:** Implement the event-driven update (Track 12) *inside* the fused kernel.
    *   **Optimization:** Use block-sparse operations (update chunks of 32 neurons, not single neurons) to keep the GPU happy.
    *   **Verification:** Measure if the *wall-clock time* actually decreases. If FLOPs go down but time goes up, revert to Dense mode for GPU and reserve Lazy mode for FPGA/CPU.

#### **Track 2: Topological Engineering (The "Signal" Stress Test)**
**Objective:** Solve the "Vanishing Signal" disclaimer found in the README.

*   **Stage 2.1: The 1,000-Layer Probe**
    *   **Action:** Using the new Engine (Track 1), initialize a 1,000-layer network.
    *   **Test:** Inject a specific pattern at Layer 1000 (Output Nudge). Measure the Euclidean distance of the perturbation at Layer 1.
    *   **Success Metric:** If the signal is indistinguishable from floating-point noise, the architecture fails. Implement **"Skip-Connections"** (Long-range wiring from Track 2) to fix this.

*   **Stage 2.2: The "Lobotomy" Robustness Check**
    *   **Action:** Train a 3D Lattice. Zero out 20% of the volume.
    *   **Test:** Run inference. Compare accuracy against a standard MLP with Dropout.
    *   **Goal:** Prove that the 3D topology offers superior degradation characteristics.

#### **Track 3: The Silicon Path (Hardware Defense)**
**Objective:** Create the physical proof that protects the project from being "just another slow Python library."

*   **Stage 3.1: The Verilog "Ternary Cell"**
    *   **Action:** Write the HDL (Hardware Description Language) for a single neuron.
    *   **Constraint:** Use **zero multipliers**. Logic must rely strictly on Add/Sub/Mux based on ternary weights.
    *   **Output:** A synthesis report showing gate count. Compare this area cost to a standard FP32 MAC unit.

*   **Stage 3.2: FPGA "Relaxation Offload"**
    *   **Action:** Deploy only the inner loop (Phase 1 & 2 of EqProp) to an FPGA (e.g., PYNQ).
    *   **Integration:** The Python script sends inputs $\to$ FPGA $\to$ Python reads Equilibrium State $\to$ Python updates weights.

#### **Track 4: Thermodynamic Logic (Advanced Capability)**
**Objective:** Demonstrate features that Backprop cannot do.

*   **Stage 4.1: Bidirectional Generation**
    *   **Action:** Clamp output classes and run the *verified* engine in reverse.
    *   **Metric:** Do the generated images look like the class? (Qualitative check of the energy landscape).

*   **Stage 4.2: The Sleep Phase**
    *   **Action:** Implement the "Negative Phase" (unlearning free-running states).
    *   **Goal:** Stabilize the "1,000-Layer Probe" (Stage 2.1) by flattening spurious energy valleys.

#### **Track 5: The "Living" Interface (Deferred)**
**Objective:** Visualization and Education. (Only execute after Engine is stable).

*   **Stage 5.1: The Real-Time Monitor**
    *   **Action:** Connect a visualizer to the running Engine.
    *   **Constraint:** Do not build a complex UI. Just dump the neuron state tensor to a raw texture buffer for display.
    *   **Goal:** Visual confirmation of "fluid-like" settling dynamics during the 1,000-layer tests.

### Summary of Revisions
1.  **Safety First:** Track 1 now explicitly mandates a "Golden Reference" harness using the existing repo code to prevent optimization bugs.
2.  **Reality Check:** Track 2 is now a specific attack on the "Vanishing Gradient" disclaimer found in the README, rather than just "building cool shapes."
3.  **UI Deferred:** Visualization is deprioritized until the physics engine is proven fast and accurate.
