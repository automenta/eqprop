The Move: Analog-Optical Implementation.
Why: Digital chips iterate to find equilibrium (slow). Photons find equilibrium at the speed of light (instant).
The Plan: Port the LoopedMLP weights to a Photonic Integrated Circuit or a Memristor Crossbar Array.
The Result: Inference latency drops from "50 loops" to 0 loops. The physics settles instantly. You get
